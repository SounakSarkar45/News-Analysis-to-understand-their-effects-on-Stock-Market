This project analyzes the stock market activity 
performance using daily world news headlines from Reddit. 
We implement our model on the movement of the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average from February 2000 to June 2020. We 
have proved the correlation between news and stock prices. 
To achieve that, the top news and the stock price data were 
gathered from the Kaggle site. We have achieved quite a high 
accuracy at 85% by vectorization method and 84 % by TF-IDF method using Random Forest Classifier. We also tried 
other machine learning algorithms. Moreover, we applied 
code without removing stopwords, as stopwords also have a 
significant effect on stock movement.
